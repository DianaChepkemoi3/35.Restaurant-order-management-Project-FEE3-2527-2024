Restaurant Order System
This is a C++ project project that simulates a restaurant order processing system.
It has multiple service queues and the system tracks orders from placement to delivery,coordinating kitchen stations and wait staff.
FEATURES
Order class with items and specifications:It handles customer orders with items and special instructions.
Station queues:Each food station(e.g.,Fryer,Oven)has its own queue.
Order prioritization:VIP orders are balanced with wait time.
Wait staff assignment and notification:Orders are linked to specific wait staff for tracking and updates.
Order tracking and status updates:The orders move through stages like Pending,Preparing and Ready.
Wait time estimation:It estimates completion time based on queue size.
Performance reports:It displays statistics like average preparation time.
Kitchen display interface:It shows kitchen tasks.
Some of the challenges encountered was coordinating multiple preparation stations and priority management.They were solved by implementing dependency tracking and balancing VIP orders with waiting time respectively.
The learning outcomes from this project are;Multi-queue coordination techniques,workflow management,priority scheduling implementation,wait time estimation algorithms,and service industry application design.
